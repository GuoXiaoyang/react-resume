# React-Resume template
A project forked by https://github.com/suddi/suddi.github.io.


[`suddi.github.io`](https://suddi.github.io) is a static single-page application resumer-builder developed using React.js. It uses the Ceevee template designed by [Styleshout](http://www.styleshout.com), ported over to React.js, and follows a customized version of the [JSON Resume schema](https://jsonresume.org/schema/) to store a Curriculum Vitae in JSON format.


I am not familiar with React ES5 grammer and I want to internationalize it with Chinese, So I forked this repo and reconstruct it with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
